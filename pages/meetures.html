    <h1>Meetures!</h1>
    
    <p>Sometime in November of 2021 I was working on a high school 3d modeling assignment and finished a bit early. Instead of going on my phone I made the conscious decision to make something fun in the 3d modeling program (fusion360). I specifically remember resisting the urge to go on my phone. I spent some time and made this:</p> 
    <script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@google/model-viewer/dist/model-viewer.min.js"></script>
    <model-viewer src="/img/glb/00001.glb" 
                camera-controls 
                touch-action="pan-y"
                auto-rotate
                environment-image="neutral"
                shadow-intensity="1"
                camera-orbit="45deg 75deg 40m"
                style="width: 100%; height: 300px; background-color: white">
    </model-viewer>

    
    Well not exactly this but something similar. Then I decided to make a list of 10 different colors, eyes, feet, and body shapes. I thought it would be cool to make 10,000 of these guys and I even made a script to generate all of them. This is number 00001. <br>


    <img src="\img\meetures\00001.png" class="meetures" style="filter: drop-shadow(3px 3px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));">

    

    Then I had an idea to make them all into NFTs. I know I know ... this was a terrible idea. I made a 
    <a href="https://x.com/Meetures0" target="_blank" class="link_word">Twitter</a>
    and started writing the script to upload all of them. I even made a Roadmap!

    <img src="/img/meetures/Meetures Roadmap.png" alt="Meetures Roadmap Part 1" style="max-width: min(60%, 400px); max-height: 60vh; height: auto; display: block; margin: 20px auto 0 auto;">
    <img src="/img/meetures/Meetures Roadmap pt2.png" alt="Meetures Roadmap Part 2" style="max-width: min(60%, 400px); max-height: 60vh; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px auto;">
    
    Then a video called
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g" target="_blank" class="link_word_big">Line Goes Up</a>
    came out. I knew some people hated NFT's but I thought they just didn't understand it. But after I watched the video, I understood why people actually hated NFTs. It wasn't that they were all guaranteed scams, it was that *almost* all of them were guaranteed scams. I was essentially wearing a burglar's mask and walking into a bank because I just thought it was fashionable. 
    <br>
    <br>So this was a waste of time! Well not entirely. I learned a lot through making this project even if I never ended up posting it on OpenSea. But I was really close to doing so lol. You can look at them if you want though:
