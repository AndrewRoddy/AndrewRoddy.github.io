    <h1>My First Game!</h1>
    <p>
        I made this game when I was 9 years old a long long time ago (5/11/2016).<br>
        It was for the science fair lol.<br><br>

        This is the description I originally wrote for the game:<br>
        Oh no! Blue Bunny lost his carrots. How will he ever tell his family?<br>
        Help Blue Bunny get them back without getting caught by the cat but beware â€¦  not all carrots are good.<br>
        If you play well you might find his Carrot Cup!<br>
        <br>
        Play as Blue Bunny through 7 fun levels. Avoid the cat and the rotten carrots.<br> Collect fresh carrots and win!
