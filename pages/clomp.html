    <h1>Clomp!</h1>
    On may 22nd 2022 I made this game in like 24 hours then I worked on it a bit more to make it better. I did it on a livestream but because the stream is longer than 12 hours so I can't share the video on YouTube. I also was using a strange audio mixer and didn't realize that my livestream music "Spotify auto reccomended" me a bunch of copywritten music that I literally couldn't hear while I was sleeping and after I woke up.
    <br>
    <br>Overall it was a lot of fun to make :) I hope you enjoy. The game is incredibly buggy though so be warned!
    <br>Its also 2 player couch co-op or CPU so that's nice.
